fetch the latest board from minesweeper.online (change the game id in game.py)
or type it by hand like in myboard.py example

If there're several islands of mines it can work longer, so try to use it only on separate ones. Or redact the fetched variant(erase the smaller parts or the bigger parts as you wish). # TODO - add automatic separation
Also `solver1.py` is better for several islands

If no new values are added after solver.py you will be provided with probabilities of empty cells. But those probabilities are probably wrong
